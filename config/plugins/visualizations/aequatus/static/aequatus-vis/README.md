# aequatus.js
Visualisation JavaScript library for Homologous Genes 

# Usage

Aequatus.js is a visualisation JavaScript library for Homologous Genes, easy to integrate with existing web services.

To use aequatus.js in your webservice use following simple snippet.

```javascript
var syntenic_data = json;
init(syntenic_data, "#settings_div", "#filter", "#sliderfilter");
drawTree(syntenic_data.tree, "#gene_tree", popup);
```

where `settings_div`, `filter_div` and `sliderfilter` are ids for the divs to hold various controls, filter options and slider; and `popup` is a callback for JavaScript function when clicked on any gene.

An example popup is included in the demo.

Functions:
```javascript
changeReference(new_gene_id, new_protein_id)
```
It is used to change reference gene in showing gene families.

# Data Format
An Example dataset is provided in the demo/data directory. 

snapshot:
```
{
  "ref":<ref gene id>,
  "protein_id":<ref protein id>,
  "tree":<genetree in JSON>
  "member":<JSON formatted genes array>
}
```

In which genetree and each gene information can be downloaded from Ensembl using REST API.
